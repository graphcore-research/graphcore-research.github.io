## Guidance for writing paper summaries

- There are three mandated headings, and a couple of suggested optional ones
(see `paper_summary_template.md`). Feel free to use other headings as you see fit.

- Please use high-res images (zoom in for those screenshots!) with alt-text provided.

- 200 words is a rough guide, but feel free to go a fair bit over or under if needs be.
No requirement to say a lot if the paper doesn't warrant it.

- Feel free to use bullet-points and other markdown syntax, including latex and code
blocks (again, see `paper_summary_template.md`).

- If you're not writing bullet-points, try to write proper prose (doesn't need to flow
wonderfully, but we're aiming for a consistent style across summaries - see example).

- Be aware that images will be scaled to the width of the text column, so narrow images may look very large.

- User-added image captions should be below plots and written in italics.
