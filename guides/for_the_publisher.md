# Publisher's Guide

This role oversees the social media output of the Graphcore research team.
They are ultimately responsible for:

- The GC research website
- The Twitter/X account (and other future platforms)
- Running the PoM meetings and making sure it happens each month

This shouldn't be too much work - the idea is to distribute any regular tasks
here across the team, but the Publisher should retain ultimate responsibility for the
health of the website, social media and PoM.

## Accounts

TODO: twitter login details (don't write here!), google analytics, hubspot?

## The website

Everything relating to running this should ideally be document in `README.md`.
Hopefully questions that aren't answered there can be resolved by:
- Looking at examples of things we've published previously
- Asking other team members (many people have done bits here-and-there)
- Asking ChatGPT & co - they're pretty good at web dev (relative to ML researchers)

## The Twitter/X account

TODO: logins, content/tone, tips (time of day/week; links; images/videos; etc)

## Running PoM

This requires:
1. Make sure the planning meetings are scheduled at a sensible time (towards the end of the month, but with enough time to do the write-ups).
2. Before the planning meeting, update the [monthly stats spreadsheet](https://graphcore.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/ResearchTeam/EV9diT22uBRNoK6pWdVjlOUBKy__1LMJd6B2HOwsaCdS4w?e=PHUg6T).
   - "Newsletter stats come from [Hubspot](https://app.hubspot.com/marketing/729091/campaigns/eab3e024-6815-47e5-84a4-f9e8ea7b1c89) (select latest month from list at bottom)
   - Twitter stats are obvious
   - Blog stats come from [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) - click on `View pages and screens` and report the number of "Active users" in the spreadsheet's "Unique readers" column (doesn't track readers who explicitly reject cookie)
3. Running the planning meetings
   - Show blog stats from the previous month (even if they're bad!)
   - Decide on an editor for the month (they should choose the deadline & basically everything else)
   - Chat through any changes / experiments you or others wish to make to the current processes
   - Solicit ideas for independent blog posts
4. Send the "Message to the editor" (below)
5. Double-check the site all looks ok once the post is live, but before it is advertised (as you have ultimate responsibility for the site!)


### Message to the editor

Thanks for agreeing to be PoM editor for this month. The guidance for editors is here: https://github.com/graphcore-research/graphcore-research.github.io-internal/blob/main/guides/for_the_editor.md.

Ideally we want to have our 4 papers decided by [deadline]. Let me know if anything is unclear, and please update the editor instructions (via a PR) if you think they could be improved in some way.
