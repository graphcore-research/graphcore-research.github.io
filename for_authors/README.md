# Guidance for writing paper summaries

## What to do & how to submit

For now, just send me a zip of a folder like `example_upload` (will move to a PR-based
system once we've settled on a process).

This should contain a single markdown file named `paper_summary.md`, with local images.
For reference, see `paper_summary_template.md`.

## Notes

- There are three mandated headings, and a couple of suggested optional ones
(see `paper_summary_template.md`). Feel free to use other headings as you see fit.

- Please use high-res images (zoom in for those screenshots!)

- 200 words is a rough guide, but feel free to go a fair bit over or under if needs be.
No requirement to say a lot if the paper doesn't warrant it.

- Feel free to use bullet-points and other markdown syntax.

- If you're not writing bullet-points, try to write proper prose (doesn't need to flow
wonderfully, but we're aiming for a consistent style across summaries - see example).

- Be aware that images will be scaled to the width of the text column, so very short
images may look too small, and very wide ones too tall (though generally don't worry).

- User-added image captions should be below plots and written in italics.
