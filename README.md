# Graphcore Research Blog

## Running locally

To run locally, execute:

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

(only needed the first time). A local instance of the blog can then be launched via:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```


## Editing

This blog is hosted on Github pages. See `settings > pages` for details.

The blog itself is derived from [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), which is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
For guidance on how to edit things on the site, your best bet is the
[Minimal Mistakes Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).
More fundamental info may instead be found in the
[Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

The site is automatically built off of the `main` branch - any merge to `main` should
automatically trigger the site to update.
