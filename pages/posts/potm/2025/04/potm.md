April has been a busy month for the AI research community, with ICLR (the first of the "big three" AI conferences of the year)
taking place in Singapore. We're pleased to share summaries of a few of our favourite papers we've seen this month.

First up, [Motion Prompting](#motion-prompting-controlling-video-generation-with-motion-trajectories) introduces flexible spatio-temporal trajectories, or "motion prompts", as a powerful new way to
control nuanced dynamic actions and motion in video generation, overcoming the limitations of text prompts.
This is followed by [Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling](#inference-time-scaling-for-generalist-reward-modeling), which presents Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT),
a method that powers DeepSeek-GRM—a generalist reward model capable of generating adaptive, high-quality rewards and achieving
strong performance gains through scalable inference-time compute.
Finally, [M1](#m1-towards-scalable-test-time-compute-with-mamba-reasoning-models) looks at using a Mamba-based architecture to tackle reasoning problems, as a more computationally-efficient approach
when compared to transformers with chains-of-thought.
