Welcome to the first edition of our Paper of the Month newsletter for 2026! 

This month, our team went through 21 different papers to find the most insightful new pieces of literature that we think have the potential to leave a mark. From this selection, three papers stood out in particular: 

-	*Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models.* Cheng et al. introduce a simple, scalable memory-augmentation for large language models to offload the cost of simple knowledge-based retrieval to embedding lookups.

-	*LTX-2: Efficient Joint Audio-Visual Foundation Model.* HaCohen et al. propose a joint text-conditioned audio-visual generation framework built using modality-specific VAEs, a refined text-conditioning module, and an asymmetric dual-stream diffusion transformer.

-	*How to Set the Batch Size for Large-Scale Pre-training?* Zhou et al. discuss how to identify the optimal batch size for large-scale pretraining, and find that dyamically increasing the batch size through time can improve performance.
