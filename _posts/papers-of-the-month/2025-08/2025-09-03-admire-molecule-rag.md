August, even with its heat waves and holidays, left no shortage of exciting research. Our top papers for this month are the following: 
- [ADMIRE-BayesOpt](#admire-bayesopt-accelerated-data-mixture-re-weighting-for-language-models-with-bayesian-optimization) that investigates how to weight different data sources when they are mixed to make a single training dataset where, using multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization, the search for the optimal mixture can be automated;
- [Stable Molecule Generation](#guiding-diffusion-models-with-reinforcement-learning-for-stable-molecule-generation) that uses a force-field based reward function to fine-tune pre-trained 3D molecule generation diffusion models with the goal of sampling physically stable and valid molecules; and
- [Graph-R1](#graph-r1-towards-agentic-graphrag-framework-via-end-to-end-reinforcement-learning) that takes an agentic RAG approach with a knowledge hypergraph to effectively represent and retrieve information from a corpus of documents.


*We hope you enjoy this month's papers as much as we did! If you have thoughts or questions, please reach out to us at [@GCResearchTeam](https://x.com/GCResearchTeam).*
